Whether it is your commercial premises or precious family home your carpets requires regular cleaning.

This not only keeps your home or office healthier and looking more attractive but also protects the life of your investment. Your carpets are subject to more wear and tear than any other item in your home. To keep your carpets free of allergens and dirt your carpets need to be cleaned every 6-12 months.

Carpets & Critters uses the Hot water extraction method or as many of our customers know it as “Steam cleaning” to remove deep soiling.

This hands down is the most effective cleaning system when it comes to cleaner, healthier and fresher smelling carpet on completion of cleaning. Under normal drying conditions your carpet should be dry within 4-6 Hours.

As the owner operator of Carpets & Critters your technician Tony Hatton has heavily invested in professional training; achieving the highest international qualifications through the IICRC.

Our equipment is modern and clean. We keep up to date with the latest technology, equipment, and products.

We pride ourselves in offering our clients the very best cleaning service.
